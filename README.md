# Sarakt Land Registry - Octavia Nebula Core

A decentralized land registry system built on Avalanche, featuring digital identity management, fractional asset ownership, and an integrated treasury system.

## Project Overview

This project consists of:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + shadcn-ui
- **Backend**: FastAPI Python backend with blockchain integration
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts deployed on Avalanche subnet
  - SaraktLandV2: ERC1155 land registry (10,000 plots)
  - SaraktDigitalID: Digital identity management
  - SaraktTreasury: Payment collection system
  - FractionalAsset: Fractional ownership of assets
  - DummyToken: Test ERC20 token

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js & npm** - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
2. **Python 3.11+** - For backend services
3. **Foundry** - For smart contract compilation
4. **Avalanche CLI** - For subnet management

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# 2. Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Install OpenZeppelin contracts (if not already done)
cd ..
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts

# 4. Configure environment (optional - keys auto-load from Avalanche CLI)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if you need custom settings (PRIVATE_KEY auto-loads from Avalanche CLI)
```

### Running the Application

**Quick Start (Recommended)**:
```bash
# Linux/Mac
./start.sh

# Windows
start.bat

# Or using npm
npm start        # Linux/Mac
npm run start:win # Windows
```

This will:
- ✅ Check and install dependencies automatically
- ✅ Start backend server on port 5001
- ✅ Start frontend server on port 8080
- ✅ Open browser automatically
- ✅ Show server logs

**Manual Start**:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend && uvicorn app:app --reload

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
npm run dev
```

### Smart Contract Deployment

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

Quick deployment:
```bash
# Check contract status
python3 scripts/manage_contracts.py status

# Deploy all contracts
python3 scripts/manage_contracts.py deploy
```
